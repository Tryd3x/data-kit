1. You can use UNION ALL to initialize and update a table, 
Sample:

-- Initialize a table with inital price of products as 10
select
    product_id,
    10 as price
from
    products
group by
    product_id
having
    min(change_date) > '2019-08-16'
union all 
-- Update price based on price before date '2018-08-16'
select
    product_id,
    new_price as price
from
    products
where
    (product_id, change_date) in (
        select
            product_id,
            max(change_date)
        from    
            products
        where
            change_date <= '2019-08-16'
        group by
            product_id
    )

2. Some countries have populations more than three times that of all of their neighbours (in the same continent). Give the countries and continents.
[name	continent	area	population	gdp]

select w1.name, w1.continent
from world w1
where population > ALL (select 3*population from world w2 where w1.name <> w2.name and w1.continent = w2.continent)
